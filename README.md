# Glue QA Tech Challenge

## Summary
For this challenge we have prepared an Android app that tells you whether you are legally allowed to Drink in the UK based on your age.

## Components:
- The Mobile application is built on the Android framework (see [android-app](https://github.com/GlueHome/qa-tech-challenge/tree/master/android-app) directory)
- The Backend service is a node service running on Heroku (see [backend-info.md](backend-info.md) file)

## Assignment:

We would like you to write tests to exercise both the API, the App by itself and the App integrated with the API. Please feel free to use any languages/tools you prefer. Extra points for writing your Mobile tests using native Mobile tools (Kotlin/Espresso for Android) since these are the tools we use at Glue.

Please implement the following:

1. Write tests to cover the service
2. Write tests to cover the mobile app only (e.g. mocked backend)
3. Write tests to cover the end-to-end functionality
4. *BONUS* Write non-functional tests (e.g Load tests for the API, etc.)

If there are potential improvements you could do to your tests that you didn't have the time to implement, please add a note with your recommendations as part of your submission.

## Assessment

We are looking to see your testing pyramid knowledge, test coverage, clean/readable/easily manteinable code, tests reliability, etc.

## Submitting your work

You can zip/upload your code into any cloud repository (e.g. Google drive) and send it to your recruiter. You can also push it to your own repository in Github, but if you do so, please keep it as private.

## Questions?

Please email cinthya@gluehome.com with any questions you have, I will try to get back to you as soon as possible. If you don't hear back from me in 24 hours, please nudge your Recruiter so that they can nudge me :)

Happy testing!
